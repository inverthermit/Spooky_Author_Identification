"""
This file creates the RNN using Keras.
It is an implementation making use of the hidden relationship between neurons.
The major task of this is to figure out the time-series relationship between T data points,
where T might not be a very large number because of the size of the dimension and the structure of the network
may influence the performance of the network.

Dataset used: time-series.
